## Abstract

Academic document intelligence systems are increasingly deployed to extract semi-structured credentials from higher education records, yet benchmarking remains constrained by statutory privacy regulations (FERPA/GDPR) that prohibit sharing authentic student data. We propose a privacy-preserving Academic Document Intelligence System featuring seed-deterministic synthetic generation (ADBG v1.0), multi-profile optical degradation, a six-stage semantic canonical normalizer, and a nine-class diagnostic OCR error taxonomy. The benchmark dataset comprises 360 synthetic specimens across certificates, marksheets, and student identity cards evaluated across four optical quality profiles (clean, scanner copy, mobile capture, and 90° rotation). In canonical live evaluation using MiniCPM-V (7.6B, Q4_0) via local Ollama runtime across 24,480 field observations, the system achieved 75.23% field F1, 74.60% raw exact match, 82.18% normalized exact match, 8.21% character error rate, and 100.00% category classification accuracy. Controlled ablation demonstrates that semantic canonicalization resolves 2,620 false-negative formatting mismatches, boosting extraction F1 from 50.00% to 95.49% (+45.49% gain) and reducing CER from 38.13% to 3.65% with high statistical significance (McNemar $\chi^2 = 2618.00, p < 0.0001$). These quantitative findings confirm that the proposed framework delivers a rigorous, privacy-compliant evaluation foundation for academic document extraction.

## 1. Introduction

Document Intelligence Systems (DIS) are increasingly deployed to automate the processing and verification of semi-structured administrative credentials in higher education, such as degree certificates, semester marksheets, official transcripts, and student identity cards [1]–[5], [26], [28], [35]. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made automated document understanding increasingly practical [9]–[15], [32]–[34]. However, benchmarking document extraction models on academic records presents critical methodological obstacles: statutory privacy regulations—such as FERPA in the United States and GDPR in the European Union—strictly prohibit the public distribution of authentic student records containing personally identifiable information (PII) [17], [28], [35]; existing document intelligence benchmarks evaluate static document collections without controlled physical or optical degradation matrices [27], [30], [33]; unnormalized exact string matching penalizes benign syntactic formatting variations and distorts extraction accuracy evaluations [25], [36]; and the domain lacks structured diagnostic error categorization specifically for academic credential extraction [28], [29], [37]. To address these challenges, this study establishes a reproducible, privacy-preserving benchmark methodology that couples seed-deterministic synthetic document generation with controlled optical degradation, multi-stage semantic canonical normalization, an automated structured error taxonomy, and decoupled read-only evaluation without requiring authentic student records [26], [31].

The key contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

1. **Synthetic Academic Credential Benchmark Generator**: We design and implement ADBG v1.0, a seed-deterministic synthetic academic credential benchmark generation methodology that compiles Typst vector templates to produce realistic certificates, marksheets, and identity cards with pixel-exact ground-truth annotations, enabling fully reproducible benchmark evaluation without requiring authentic student records [26], [35].
2. **AU DIC Evaluation Subsystem**: We establish a decoupled, strictly read-only benchmark execution architecture that conducts structured document intelligence evaluations, raw model inference parsing, and ground-truth pairing without modifying underlying production data stores [31].
3. **Six-Stage Semantic Canonical Normalization**: We introduce a multi-stage domain-specific normalization layer (CanonicalNormalizer) that standardizes dates, identifiers, numerical marks, degree titles, and institutional aliases prior to metric calculation, insulating evaluation metrics from superficial formatting discrepancies [25], [36].
4. **Nine-Class Structured OCR Error Taxonomy**: We develop an automated diagnostic classification module that categorizes field-level extraction failures into nine mutually exclusive error classes (including character recognition errors, omissions, hallucinations, and syntax mismatches), replacing uninformative aggregate scalar metrics with root-cause diagnostic insights [28], [37].
5. **Controlled Optical Quality-Profile Robustness Framework**: We formalize a systematic evaluation matrix across four standardized optical quality profiles (*clean*, *scanner_copy*, *mobile_camera*, and *rotated_90*) to evaluate and quantify model extraction decay under controlled physical and optical capture distortions [27], [30], [33].

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys related work and outlines the research gap. Section 3 details the proposed methodology, including the decoupled system architecture and complete end-to-end data flow. Section 4 specifies the experimental setup, dataset composition, evaluation protocol, and mathematical formulations of metrics. Section 5 presents and discusses the empirical results, statistical analyses, ablation findings, error-taxonomy analysis, classification benchmark, scientific interpretation, and threats to validity. Section 6 concludes the paper, and Section 7 outlines future work.

## 2. Related Work

Research in Document Artificial Intelligence (Document AI) has progressed from classical Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines and rule-based spatial parsers across static receipt and form benchmarks—including RVL-CDIP [1], SROIE [2], CORD [3], FUNSD [4], and DocVQA [5]—to multimodal architectures such as LayoutLMv3 [6], TrOCR [8], and OCR-free models like Donut [7]. Recent 2025–2026 developments have established advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Florence-2 [9], mPLUG-DocOwl2 [10], Qwen2.5-VL [11], TextMonkey [12], LLaVA-NeXT-Doc [15], DocFormers 2.0 [32], GOT-OCR2.0 [38], and MinerU2.5 [43], which significantly enhance high-resolution page parsing and complex tabular grid interpretation [34], [47]. However, evaluating these document understanding systems on academic credentials (such as degree certificates, semester marksheets, transcripts, and student identity cards) introduces fundamental methodological obstacles that existing benchmarks do not adequately resolve. First, statutory privacy frameworks—specifically FERPA in the United States and GDPR in the European Union—prohibit the public dissemination of authentic student records containing personally identifiable information [17], [28], [35], [48]. Second, conventional document evaluation protocols rely on raw string matching that severely penalizes benign formatting differences, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific semantic canonical normalization [20], [25], [36]. Third, aggregate scalar metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) [21] conflate disparate failure modes, underscoring the requirement for structured diagnostic error taxonomies [37], [49]. Finally, model robustness is rarely evaluated across systematic physical and optical degradation matrices [27], [30], [33], [44]. While the existing literature provides strong individual advancements in multimodal architectures and synthetic data synthesis, to the best of our knowledge, prior work lacks an integrated, privacy-preserving academic credential benchmarking methodology that unifies seed-deterministic synthetic generation, controlled optical degradation, semantic canonical normalization, structured error diagnostics, and decoupled read-only evaluation. This critical research gap directly motivates the ADBG v1.0 and AU DIC framework developed in this study [26], [31].

## 3. Methodology

The Smart Academic Document Intelligence System is architected around two strictly decoupled functional subsystems: the **Academic Document Benchmark Generator (ADBG v1.0)**, which handles synthetic credential synthesis and optical degradation, and the **AU DIC Evaluation Subsystem**, which performs model prediction ingestion, semantic canonical normalization, multi-metric scoring, and diagnostic error classification [26], [31].

**Fig. 1. System Architecture of the Proposed Academic Document Intelligence and Benchmark Evaluation Framework.**

The system architecture illustrated in Fig. 1 is organized into two strictly decoupled operational subsystems: (1) the Academic Document Benchmark Generator (ADBG v1.0), which fabricates synthetic student records from Typst vector templates and applies a 14-operator optical degradation pipeline across four standardized quality profiles, and (2) the AU DIC Evaluation Subsystem, which performs live zero-shot inference ingestion, multi-stage semantic canonical normalization, multi-metric evaluation, and nine-class structured error classification without mutating persistent datastores.

**Fig. 2. Data Flow Diagram of the Proposed Academic Document Intelligence Evaluation System.**

The Data Flow Diagram depicted in Fig. 2 traces the end-to-end data transformation lifecycle across the benchmark generation and evaluation pipeline: Level 0 (Context Level) outlines the external interaction boundaries between model evaluators, the synthetic document generator, and the evaluation engine; Level 1 (Framework Execution Flow) details the internal data routing from template compilation and degradation to zero-shot inference, six-stage canonical normalization, and statistical metric calculation; and Level 2 (Diagnostic Error Classification & Evaluation Engine) decomposes the core normalization and nine-class OCR error classification mechanisms.

To isolate the synthetic formatting discrepancy correction capability of the Six-Stage Semantic Canonical Normalizer independently from visual perception errors, a two-pass rule ablation study was conducted across all 24,480 field observations. As summarized in Table 9 and visualized in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, canonical normalization resolved superficial syntax variations, increasing Field F1 from 50.00% to 95.49% (+45.49% net gain) while reducing Character Error Rate from 38.13% to 3.65% (a 90.42% relative error reduction).

The CanonicalNormalizer resolved 2,620 false-negative field mismatches across six specialized domain rules as reported in Table 10. Date and Roll Number normalizers contributed the largest shares (720 corrections each, 27.48%), while Degree, Numeric, and Honorific rules resolved 360 errors each (13.74%), with rule-wise distributions and granular field-by-field accuracy improvements illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.

Rigorous statistical hypothesis testing reported in Table 11 confirms that metric improvements from canonicalization are highly significant ($p < 0.0001$, McNemar $\chi^2 = 2618.00$, Wilcoxon $W = 64980.0$, Paired $t = 307.87$). Furthermore, 10,000-iteration non-parametric bootstrap resampling in Table 12 establishes non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals between Pass A (F1: [48.72%, 51.28%]) and Pass B (F1: [94.93%, 96.01%]).

The nine-class diagnostic OCR error taxonomy distribution shift detailed in Table 13 evaluates 5,760 core scalar metadata observations across the 360 specimens ($360 \times 16$ canonical fields). All 2,620 `FORMAT_ERROR` instances in Pass A were systematically converted into character-perfect `EXACT_MATCH` records in Pass B (raising exact match from 50.00% to 95.49%), while 260 genuine `NORMALIZATION_ERROR` cases (4.51%) were preserved, proving that canonicalization isolates formatting discrepancies without concealing model recognition errors.

To assess extraction failure predictability from document and degradation features, classical Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers were evaluated across 24,480 observations. As reported in Table 14, Decision Trees achieved superior performance (93.69% accuracy, 95.91% F1, 0.8303 MCC) due to crisp axis-aligned step-function splits, compared against Random Forest bagging models in the composite confusion matrices of Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.

## 6. Conclusion

Benchmarking document intelligence systems on academic credentials remains bottlenecked by statutory privacy regulations such as FERPA and GDPR, alongside rigid string evaluation metrics that artificially penalize benign formatting variances [25], [28], [35]. To resolve these limitations, this paper presented a reproducible synthetic evaluation methodology (ADBG v1.0 and AU DIC Framework v1.0) [26], [31]. The framework integrates seed-deterministic credential compilation, a six-stage semantic canonical normalizer, an automated nine-class OCR error taxonomy [37], and a four-profile optical degradation matrix [30]. Live empirical evaluation across 360 specimens (24,480 paired observations) confirmed that canonical normalization isolates genuine extraction failures (McNemar $\chi^2 = 2618.00, p < 0.0001$) [22], [25], establishing a standardized, privacy-preserving benchmark foundation [26], [31].

## 7. Future Work

Promising avenues for future research encompass three primary dimensions to further expand the benchmark capability. First, ADBG v2.0 will introduce multi-lingual credential synthesis supporting Indic scripts (Hindi, Tamil, Devanagari) and multi-lingual institutional degree layouts [26]. Second, we will expand Option A image-based benchmarking across leading vision-language foundation models (Donut [7], Florence-2 [9], GOT-OCR2.0 [38], LLaVA-NeXT-Doc [15], DocFormers 2.0 [32]) and specialized OCR systems (Tesseract [19], MinerU [43]) to measure extraction robustness under severe optical distortions [30]. Third, multi-model comparative benchmarking will incorporate instruction-tuned multimodal architectures (such as LayoutLMv2 [46] and DocFormers 2.0 [32]) to deliver comprehensive model rankings and cross-domain diagnostic evaluations across diverse higher education administrative workflows [31].
